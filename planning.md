# Planning

I asked chatGPT to make me a plan for developing snake from scratch in rust. Here
is what I got. Today (day 1) is 29th of April.

## ChatGPTs plan:
### Phase 1: Set up development environment and basic game loop (2 weeks) 13 May

1. [ ] Research and install Rust and its package manager, Cargo.
2. [ ] Create a new Rust project and set up dependencies for window creation and input handling.
3. [ ] Build a basic game loop that renders a black window and handles user input.
4. [ ] Research and integrate the Snake game logic into the game loop.

### Phase 2: Implement game mechanics (2 weeks) 27 May

1. [ ] Build the Snake entity and its movement mechanics.
2. [ ] Add food spawning and collision detection for the Snake.
3. [ ] Implement the game scoring system and game over conditions.

### Phase 3: Graphics and sound (2 weeks) 10 June

1. [ ] Research and integrate the OpenGL library to render game graphics.
2. [ ] Design and implement 2D graphics for the game (e.g. Snake, food, game board).
3. [ ] Add sound effects and background music to the game.

### Phase 4: Testing and debugging (2 weeks) 24 June

1. [ ] Test the game and debug any errors or issues found.
2. [ ] Optimize the game for better performance and user experience.
3. [ ] Add any final touches or features to the game.

### Phase 5: Deployment and distribution (1 week) 1 July

1. [ ] Build and package the game for Linux.
2. [ ] Create a distribution plan and publish the game to a public repository.
3. [ ] Document the game and provide instructions for users.
